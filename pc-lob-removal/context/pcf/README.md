# PCF Agent — Knowledge Base

Context, rules, skills, and tools for the `gw-pcf-agent` specializing in Guidewire PCF (Page Configuration Format) development.

## How this is organized

- **`context/pcf/`** — background/reference knowledge. What things are, how they relate, how they work conceptually. 22 files.
- **`rules/pcf-agent-rules/`** — firm, checkable conventions. "Always/never" statements. Violating these produces invalid PCF or real upgrade/performance problems, not just style issues. 9 files.
- **`skills/pcf-agent-skills/`** — step-by-step, task-shaped workflows for concrete jobs ("build X," "wire up Y"). 10 skills.
- **`skills/pcf-find-usages/`** — find where a PCF file or element is referenced across the codebase.
- **`tools/pcf/`** — debugging/inspection aids (keyboard shortcuts, editor conventions).

## Known Gaps

Notable items not yet fully resolved:
- `PanelSet`'s exact place in the container hierarchy taxonomy
- Several minor naming-suffix and attribute-syntax gaps (List View Input widget, `locationref`'s `location` attribute syntax, navigation cell widgets)
- The full `modules/pcf.html`/`.htm` schema reference was never directly obtained — everything here is built from Education material, real project code, and (filtered/corrected) public documentation

## Provenance Note

Content is drawn from three tiers of source, in descending order of trust:
1. **Real project `.pcf` code** — highest confidence, used to resolve several conflicts.
2. **Guidewire Education modules** — high confidence, structured course material (majority of this knowledge base).
3. **Public Guidewire documentation, via a Documentation Assistant** — lower confidence; several early conflicts came from this tier and were resolved or flagged. Used mainly in the earliest files (context 01–11).

Where sources conflicted, resolution notes are preserved inline in the relevant file rather than silently overwritten, so the reasoning stays auditable.
