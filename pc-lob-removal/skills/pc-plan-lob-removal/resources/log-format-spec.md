# LOB Removal Work Log Format Specification

## Overview

The work log serves two purposes:

1. **Execution log** — chronological record of every action taken during LOB removal, with timestamps and outcomes.
2. **Fallout log** — categorized inventory of what was removed, added, and modified so a developer can audit the full impact of the removal and roll back selectively if needed.

## File Location and Naming

```
.pwc/agent/work-logs/lob-removal-<LOB_CODE>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHmmss>.md
```

Example: `.pwc/agent/work-logs/lob-removal-BP7-20260908-143022.md`

If the same LOB removal is resumed after a failure, the agent appends to the existing log file rather than creating a new one. A `[RESUMED]` marker is inserted at the resumption point.

## Log Structure

The log file is divided into four sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Header** | Run metadata — LOB code, alternate names, project root, start time, agent versions |
| **Phase Log** | Chronological entries grouped by phase, each action tagged by category |
| **Fallout Summary** | Aggregated lists of all removed, added, and modified files |
| **Run Result** | Final status, total counts, duration, and unresolved issues |

## Section 2: Phase Log

Each phase is a second-level heading. Within a phase, each action is a table row tagged with an **action category** and an **outcome**.

### Action Categories

| Tag        | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `REMOVED`  | A file, folder, property, entity entry, or code block was deleted |
| `ADDED`    | A new file was created (e.g., a plan file, a patched config) |
| `MODIFIED` | An existing file was edited (e.g., removing LOB references from a shared file) |
| `EXECUTED` | A build tool command was run (e.g., `gwb compile`) |
| `VERIFIED` | An exit criterion was checked |
| `SKIPPED`  | An expected artifact was not found — nothing to act on |
| `QUERY`    | A question was asked to the user |
| `ERROR`    | An action failed; includes error detail |

### Outcome Values

| Outcome     | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `OK`        | Action completed successfully |
| `FAIL`      | Action failed — see the detail column |
| `WARN`      | Action completed with a non-blocking warning |
| `PENDING`   | Action awaiting user confirmation or deferred |
| `N/A`       | Not applicable (used for `QUERY` entries) |

### Phase Entry Format

```markdown
## Phase <N>: <Phase Title>

| # | Timestamp            | Category   | Outcome | Target                                                        | Detail                                          | Agent            |

| 4 | 2026-09-08T14:32:44Z | VERIFIED   | OK      | Exit criteria: baseline established                           | All 3 build commands succeeded                   | gw-planner       |
| 5 | 2026-09-08T14:32:45Z | QUERY      | N/A     | User confirmation to proceed                                  | User approved                                    | gw-planner       |

### Exit Criteria Results
- [x] `gwb clean` completed successfully
- [x] `gwb compile` completed successfully
- [x] `gwb runServer` completed successfully
```

### Examples by Category

**REMOVED — file deletion:**
```
| 12 | 2026-09-08T14:35:22Z | REMOVED | OK | `configuration/config/web/pcf/line/BP7/` | Folder deleted, 47 files | gw-pcf-agent |
```

**REMOVED — property removal from a shared file:**
```
| 18 | 2026-09-08T15:10:03Z | MODIFIED | OK | `configuration/config/locale/display.properties` | Removed 214 properties matching `*.BP7.*` | gw-planner |
```

**ADDED — generated plan or patch file:**
```
| 6 | 2026-09-08T15:22:01Z | ADDED | OK | `.pwc/agent/plans/compile-fix-BP7-phase12.md` | Fix plan for 3 compile errors | gw-gosu-agent |
```

**SKIPPED — artifact not found:**
```
| 9 | 2026-09-08T14:55:11Z | SKIPPED | OK | `configuration/gsrc/gw/webservice/pc/pc910/ccintegration/lob/CCBP7*` | No matching file found | gw-gosu-agent |
```

**ERROR — build failure:**
```
| 22 | 2026-09-08T15:30:45Z | EXECUTED | FAIL | `gwb compile` | Exit code 1, 3 errors — see detail below | gw-gosu-agent |
```

When an `ERROR` entry needs extended detail (stack traces, multi-line output), append a fenced block immediately after the phase table:

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Error detail for entry #22</summary>

` ` `
gsrc/gw/lob/common/LobPropertyServices.gs:42: error: cannot resolve symbol 'BP7Line'
gsrc/cust/lob/common/validation/PolicyPeriodValidation_Ext.gs:18: error: unknown type 'BP7Jurisdiction'
` ` `
</details>
```

### Resumed Run Marker

When a log is reopened after a prior failure:

```markdown
---
### [RESUMED] 2026-09-08T16:00:00Z — Resuming from Phase 4 after compile failure fix
---
```

## Section 3: Fallout Summary

This section aggregates all impacted files across every phase, grouped by action category. It is the developer's audit trail.

## Agent Logging Rules

1. **Every action gets a row.** No silent deletions or edits. If a file is touched, it appears in the phase log.
2. **Timestamps are UTC ISO 8601.** Example: `2026-09-08T14:30:22Z`.
3. **Fallout summary is built incrementally.** Each agent appends to the summary tables as it completes actions. The summary is not reconstructed at the end — it grows with the log.
4. **Errors include enough context to reproduce.** At minimum: the command or file, the error message, and the exit code if applicable.
5. **SKIPPED entries are mandatory.** If an expected file or folder does not exist, log it as `SKIPPED` rather than silently moving on. This lets the developer verify that nothing was missed due to a naming mismatch.
6. **User queries and responses are logged.** When a `QUERY` entry is recorded, the `Detail` column captures the user's response.
7. **Phase boundaries are explicit.** Each phase heading includes the start timestamp. The exit criteria checklist closes the phase.
8. **One log per LOB removal run.** Resumed runs append to the same file with a `[RESUMED]` marker.
